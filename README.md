# Fruits-Recognition-AI-Project

Fruits Recognition is an A.I. project, which recognises fruit in real time. 

# File classification:

* 1.dataset.txt has the link for the data
* 2.FruitsClassification.ipynb is used to train the model
* 3.EfficientNet_FruitsClassification.ipynb is used for the real time prediction.

# Required Libraries:

* Tensorflow 
* Numpy
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* Pathlib


# Procedure:

* 1.Getting Data from the zip
* 2.Unzipping the zip
* 3.Importing the libraries
* 4.Creating the Pathlib Path objects
* 5.Getting Image Paths
* 6.Getting their Respective Labels
* 7.Define Image size and Batch size
* 8.Create a Tensorflow Data Object
* 9.Sampling Validation Image
* 10.Building ResNet50 model
* 11.Traning the model
* 12.Defining our callbacks
* 13.Training the model
* 14.Evaluating the loaded model
* 15.Realtime Prediction
